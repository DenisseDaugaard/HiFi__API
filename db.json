In the 1950s WG Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham's HiFi Corner. Upon his retirement, Graham Trio bought the business and modernized the name to HiFi Horizon.",
        "Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who was recommended by Linn's own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to manage the shop, with a knack for business and the desire to succeed. By 1980 Colin MacKenzie had become the owner of HiFi Horizon. Today, Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the company's Managing Director."
